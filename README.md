# Avengers video calling app

> Hello guys, recently we created our own avengers video calling app using react.js, Next.js, peer js., node js, Express, The concepts might be a little bit difficult   but we will try to explain with our best efforts. But before getting started letâ€™s know about some of its core features:

- Video calling 
- generate random Id


> Socket.io
  Socket.io is used for real-time and event-based communication between the client(browser) and sever.
  # Installation
   npm install socket.io
  
> Peer js
  PeerJS simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls. PeerJS wraps the browserâ€™s WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-     to-use peer-to-peer connection API

> what is webrtc?
  Webrtc is used for real-time media communication (Voice and Video Chat) between devices. webrtc allows us to capture the microphone, camera, or screen of the device   which we can share that data with other users.
